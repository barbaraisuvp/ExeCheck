javaws.exe is a process that belongs to the Java Web Start technology, which allows users to launch Java applications directly from the internet using a web browser. This executable file is responsible for handling the deployment of Java applications and managing the resources required for their execution. When a user clicks on a link to a Java application on a webpage, javaws.exe is invoked to download and run the application on the user's system. This process helps to simplify the deployment and updating of Java applications, as it eliminates the need for users to manually download and install software. However, javaws.exe can also be a target for malware and other security threats, so it is important for users to exercise caution when running Java applications from the web.
